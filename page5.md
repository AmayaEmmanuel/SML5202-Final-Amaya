<h1><strong>Language Learning Tips&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To effectively learn a language, in this case, Spanish, you must pay specific attention to the following sections:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading&nbsp;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing&nbsp;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening&nbsp;</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are key to being able to reach a high level of fluency.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To improve your Reading in Spanish, you should:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Spanish subtitles when watching TV&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change the language on your most used device to Spanish (for me that would be my laptop)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shop around for some bilingual books - with Spanish on one side and the English translation on the other side</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at recipes, newspapers and magazines in Spanish (even if you don&rsquo;t understand it, your brain will start to recognise the look of the words and before you know it you&rsquo;ll be able to sound words out in Spanish - this will help majorly with your Speaking).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>To improve your Speaking in Spanish, you should:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try finding a pen-pal online one you can type and chat to in person, this will improve your reaction time and you should also ask them to correct you if you make a mistake&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See if your educational institution has a Spanish society, this will introduce you to native speakers or other beginners with similar interest to you. Both work in your favour though! If you meet other beginners you can form a study group and help each other practise and if you meet natives they can help you in the same ways your Spanish pen-pal would.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have time you should try to go to a Spanish speaking place. This will allow you to be surrounded by the culture and sooner or later you&rsquo;ll have to speak Spanish, whether it be to order something to eat or drink, or to ask for directions or to ask the price of something. This technique is kind of like learning to swim by going straight into the deep end- it&rsquo;s very good but quite intense.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To improve your Writing in Spanish, you should:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to practising verb conjugations- this will help with your speech too. In languages TENSES ARE EVERYTHING :)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practise making small sentences then adding onto them&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a pen-pal in a Spanish speaking place and send them written letters- it is better to use pen and paper for this since computers have spell-checks and automatically correct you, sometimes without you knowing :(&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Finally to improve your Listening in Spanish, you should:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to Spanish radio - this is good because sometimes they ask questions and if you can formulate an answer it shows you&rsquo;re improving. This is also very beneficial because you can be multitasking while you listen; you could be driving or showering or cleaning, as long as you can hear the radio you&rsquo;re good to go!&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Watch telenovelas and Spanish TV - what better way to learn?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to spanish music - below I have a video of one of my favourite super-catchy Spanish songs. It is called Est&aacute; Rico and stars Marc Anthony, Will Smith and Bad Bunny. If you can hear a slight difference in accent it is because Bad Bunny is Puerto Rican and although Will Smith is not actually a Spanish speaker his pronunciation is fantastic! Marc Anthony and Bad Bunny have some other really great songs if you want to have a look?&nbsp;</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Below are a few more quick tips:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language learning needs repetition, commitment and investment and it is way more beneficial to study intensely and do vocabulary games rather than to sit for hours and not really learn anything.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try and learn the language on your own rather than in a class, I say this because the class speed is usually determined by the students who struggle the most. The general scenario is if a student doesn&rsquo;t understand the topic more time will be spent going over it, even though you may have understood it the first time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting goals - even if it&rsquo;s just to learn the days of the week by the end of the week. ALWAYS SET REALISTIC GOALS&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a list of the words in English you use the most, translate them to Spanish then repeat, repeat, repeat, until you have them memorized and then you can start trying to use them in sentences.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk with a translator handy- it could be on your phone or even a pocket dictionary&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practise, practise, practise!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you learn a new word try to use it as much as you can&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JUST HAVE FUN WITH IT! </span></li>
</ul>
