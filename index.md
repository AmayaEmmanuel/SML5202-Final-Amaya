<p>Here are three facts about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was born in England, so my first language is English.</li>
<li>I study Spanish at Queen Mary Univeristy of London</li>
<li>I enjoy learning about Spanish Culture, whether that be through telenovelas, reading or music</li>
</ol>
<p>One of my favourite language learning websites is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a></p>
<p>I made this website for beginners who want to learn about Spain, the European Spanish language and Spanish Culture quickly and easily. As a part of my course at Queen Mary University I am able to study abroad to improve my Spanish even more and this is just one of the many ways a beginner in Spanish can improve.</p>

<p>Before we begin, lets look at some Fun Facts about Spain:</p>	
<ul>
<li>Although Spanish is the main langauage spoken in Spain, there are 4 other official languages; Catalan (Catalonia and the Balearic Islands), Basque (Basque Country and Navarre), Galician (Galicia) and Aranese (Catalonia).</li>
<li> Approximately 406 million people in the world speak Spanish and about 47 million live in Spain as of 2019.</li> 
<li> The largest city in Spain is the captial, Madrid (population size- 3.3 million) and the second largest city is Barcelona, in Catalonia.</li> 
<li> Spain is best known for its siestas (day-time naps after lunch), its Paella (an eminent rice and shrimp dish) and its Tapas.</li>
<li> 1 Euro in Spain = 89 pence in the United Kindgom, but the cost of living is one of the lowest in Western Europe (Yay!)</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Finally some quick tips for learning Spanish:</p>	
<ol>
<li>Watch Spanish interviews and tv, this will help with your understanding of various accents and also help build your vocabulary.</li>
<li> Find a Spanish-Speaking parter, if you can:).</li> 
<li> Be consistent and commit at least 15 minutes a day to learning.</li> 
<li> If you do these things, learning Spanish with me should be a breeze!</li>
	</ol>
	
	
<p> As you can see below Spain has various landscapes and this gives the natives, and people who want to live in Spain, numerous choices, you could live by the beach, in the city or in a local Spanish town. It really just depends on the culture and lifestyle that suits you.
